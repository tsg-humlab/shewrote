                The SHEWROTE database allows users to stock, share and analyze historical data documenting
                the international reception of works by women writers before c. 1940. The data includes evidence of book
                ownership, readership, re-editions, translations, intertextual references and commentary on (works by)
                women writers. The database is coordinated by members of the international NEWW Network (New approaches
                to European Women’s Writing, created in 2005) and the DARIAH-EU working group ‘Women Writers in
                History’. For more information on this working group, please see
